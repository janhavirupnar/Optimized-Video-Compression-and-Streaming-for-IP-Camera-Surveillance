# Advanced Video Compression & Real-Time Streaming ðŸ“¹âš¡

This repository contains my project from the **BARC (Homi Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) internship**, where I implemented **advanced video compression and real-time streaming** for IP camera footage.  
The project leverages **FFmpeg, GStreamer, VLC**, and **hardware acceleration on Raspberry Pi 4**, along with **Python automation scripts** for performance monitoring and log analysis.  

## ðŸ”Ž Key Features:
- ðŸ“Œ Real-time video compression of IP camera streams  
- ðŸ“Œ Hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding on Raspberry Pi 4  
- ðŸ“Œ Streaming pipelines with FFmpeg, GStreamer, and VLC  
- ðŸ“Œ Python scripts for log collection and performance monitoring  
- ðŸ“Œ Optimized for low latency and resource efficiency  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Tools:** FFmpeg, GStreamer, VLC, OpenCV  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4  
- **Concepts:** Real-time streaming, video encoding/decoding, performance monitoring  

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings:
- Hands-on experience in video compression techniques and streaming pipelines  
- Implemented **hardware-accelerated video processing** on embedded devices  
- Automated monitoring & analysis of video stream performance using Python
